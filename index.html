These skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript & jQuery, PHP, SQL, Python, GitHub, and a little C/C++. It would be suffice to say that I am quite familiar with the LAMP Stack. I have also learned to use other Operating Systems, Software, and Frameworks over the years. I'm delighted you're here, and I love feedback. This website is still in development, but you can check it every day for the most recent updates. I will remove “in development” from the description from my website when I have completed the website. I update my profile from time to time to ensure that everyone reading gets the most recent up-to-date information on my latest projects.">
